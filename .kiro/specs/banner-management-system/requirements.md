# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Banner Management System is designed to provide administrators with the ability to dynamically manage the slide banners displayed on the homepage of the Vasantham Real Estate Management System. Currently, banners are hardcoded in the index.php file, but this feature will introduce a comprehensive admin interface to add, edit, view, and delete banner images with associated details. This ensures that the homepage can be kept fresh and updated without requiring code changes.
